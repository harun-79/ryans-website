## Setup & Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5173` with API proxying to the backend.

### 3. Build for Production

Create an optimized build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates the `public/` directory which the backend serves.

### 4. Preview Built App

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Frontend Features

- **Login/Register**: User authentication with JWT tokens
- **Product Grid**: Browse featured handmade art products
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items, adjust quantities
- **M-Pesa Checkout**: Integrated M-Pesa payment option
- **Regular Checkout**: Standard order placement

## Architecture

- **React Hooks**: State management with `useState`, `useEffect`
- **Component-Based**: Modular UI components
- **API Utilities**: Centralized API calls and localStorage management
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server with HMR

## Backend Integration

- Frontend proxies API calls to `/api/*` endpoints
- Backend serves React build output from `frontend/public/`
- Supports SPA routing by serving `index.html` for non-existent routes

## Environment Variables

No special env vars needed for development. The vite dev server proxies to:
- API: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/*`
- Uploads: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/uploads/*`

## Available Routes (Client-Side)

- `/` - Home (login/products)
- `/#gallery` - Gallery view
- `/#admin` - Admin panel (if logged in)

## Notes

- All user data is stored in browser localStorage
- Authentication tokens are persisted locally
- Cart contents are managed via localStorage
- Forms include loading states and error handling
